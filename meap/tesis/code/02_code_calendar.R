##### Creating Calendar ##### 
# **NEED TO MODIFY IF THERE ARE DATES OUTSIDE THE RANGE**
#  I create a daily and weekly calendar, given a start and end year, so I can count the weeks that passed between different events (I have the information at a daily level; first, I know what week it is, and then I can combine it with the weekly one, which is my time unit). Observations:
#  - I only keep the years in which federal surveys are conducted (INEGI).
#- The way  I created the weekly DF is not fully automated; the variable *n_week* must be added each time an additional year is added to the DF.

start_date <- as.Date("2011-01-01")  # Adjust the start date as needed
end_date <- as.Date("2025-12-31")    # Adjust the end date as needed

# Generate a sequence of dates representing each week
week_dates <- seq(start_date, end_date, by = "1 week")
daily_dates <- seq(start_date, end_date, by = "1 day")

# Create a data frame with a 'week' column
weekly_df <- data.frame(Week = week_dates)
daily_df <- data.frame(Day = daily_dates)
